						Dear Students, Parents and Teachers,

Society is changing rapidly in many ways which will have a profound impact on the youth. However, in this changing world, knowledge will remain a key resource around the globe. The dynamics of the fast-changing world urges the academicians to give the right impetus for making life-long learners out of students. At Usha Pravin Gandhi College the key focus has been to impart professional education whilst keeping pace with a world that is quite dynamic and competitive. The academic staff at the college leaves no stone unturned in making our student community ready and equipped with the required abilities to interpret and utilize newer technology in all walks of life.

I welcome all the students who chose to be a part of SVKM’s Usha Pravin Gandhi College of Arts, Science and Commerce in the new academic year. I am sure that you will feel proud to be associated with us and make us equally proud with your academic excellence and accomplishments in the future.

My best wishes to all at Usha Pravin Gandhi College of Arts, Science and Commerce at the start of 2020-2022.
